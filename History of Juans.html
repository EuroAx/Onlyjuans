    <td><p>The name Juan traces its origins to ancient Hebrew, where it finds its roots in the name Yochanan, meaning "Yahweh is gracious" or "God is gracious." Yochanan was a common name among Jews in biblical times and was later adopted by Christian communities, particularly in Spain and Latin America. Through cultural exchanges and linguistic evolution, Yochanan morphed into Juan, becoming one of the most prevalent Spanish given names. It gained widespread popularity across Spanish-speaking regions and beyond, embodying a sense of divine favor and benevolence, which has contributed to its enduring appeal and usage across diverse cultures and languages.</p></td>
